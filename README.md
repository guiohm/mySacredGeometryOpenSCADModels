# mySacredGeometryOpenSCADModels

This is basically my personnal directory of Sacred geometry models intended to be 3D printed. There's a lot of french, because, well.. I'm french.
These are not intended to be user friendly. I made those for a friend (and also for me) and this is designed for a specific purpose. So you likely won't have any use of this.
